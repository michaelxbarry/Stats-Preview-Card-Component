## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive Design

### What I learned

I learnt the basics of Grid and how to create various layouts, responsive web design (I think I should improve more on that) and how to work with images. This was also the first challenge where I used some Custom properties and played with pseudo-elements.
